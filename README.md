In the project, it is used as a CSR method to parse remote document data. Because there is no Release for the new version, the code base used by the project is [[#3b7929a](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery/commit/3b7929a0d759a20968ba605c56bc3027c30d3527)].
- [@andybalholm](https://github.com/andybalholm), He implements a Go implementation of a CSS selector library [cascadia](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia), which is the core dependency of goquery under the [BSD-2-Clause license](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia/blob/master/LICENSE). Because there is no Release for the new version, the code base used by the project is [[#c6065e4](https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia/commit/c6065e4618b7f538edf5ca0d6b5b2fd0fe129fdd)]
